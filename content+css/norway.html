    <h2> Kingdom of Norway </h2>
    <p>
        Kingdom of Norway is a Nordic country in Northwestern Europe whose territory comprises the western and northernmost portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula;
        the remote island of Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard are also part of the Kingdom of Norway.
        The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the kingdom.
        Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land.

        Environment
    </p>
      <p>
          Attractive and dramatic scenery and landscape are found throughout Norway.
          The west coast of southern Norway and the coast of northern Norway present some of the most visually impressive coastal sceneries in the world.
          National Geographic has listed the Norwegian fjords as the world's top tourist attraction.
          The country is also home to the natural phenomena of the Midnight sun (during summer), as well as the Aurora borealis known also as the Northern lights.

      <p>
      The 2016 Environmental Performance Index from Yale University,
          Columbia University and the World Economic Forum put Norway in seventeenth place, immediately below Croatia and Switzerland.
          The index is based on environmental risks to human health, habitat loss, and changes in CO2 emissions.
          The index notes over-exploitation of fisheries, but not Norway's whaling or oil exports. <br />
    <p> Climate </p>
      <p>
      The southern and western parts of Norway, fully exposed to Atlantic storm fronts, experience more precipitation and have milder winters than the eastern and far northern parts.
      Areas to the east of the coastal mountains are in a rain shadow, and have lower rain and snow totals than the west.
      The lowlands around Oslo have the warmest and sunniest summers, but also cold weather and snow in wintertime.
