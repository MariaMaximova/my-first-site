    <h2> Ireland </h2>
    <p>
        Ireland is an island in the North Atlantic.
        It is separated from Great Britain to its east by the North Channel, the Irish Sea, and St George's Channel.
        Ireland is the second-largest island of the British Isles, the third-largest in Europe, and the twentieth-largest on Earth.
    </p>
      <p>
          Geopolitically, Ireland is divided between the Republic of Ireland (officially named Ireland), which covers five-sixths of the island, and Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom.
          In 2011, the population of Ireland was about 6.6 million, ranking it the second-most populous island in Europe after Great Britain.
          Just under 4.8 million live in the Republic of Ireland and just over 1.8 million live in Northern Ireland.
      <br />
          The geography of Ireland comprises relatively low-lying mountains surrounding a central plain, with several navigable rivers extending inland.
          Its lush vegetation is a product of its mild but changeable climate which is free of extremes in temperature.
          Much of Ireland was woodland until the end of the Middle Ages.
          Today, woodland makes up about 10% of the island, compared with a European average of over 33%, and most of it is non-native conifer plantations.

        Climate
      </p>
      <p>
        The island's lush vegetation, a product of its mild climate and frequent rainfall, earns it the sobriquet the Emerald Isle. Overall, Ireland has a mild but changeable oceanic climate with few extremes.
          The climate is typically insular and is temperate, avoiding the extremes in temperature of many other areas in the world at similar latitudes.
          This is a result of the moderating moist winds which ordinarily prevail from the South-Western Atlantic.
          <br />
          Precipitation falls throughout the year but is light overall, particularly in the east. The west tends to be wetter on average and prone to Atlantic storms, especially in the late autumn and winter months.
          These occasionally bring destructive winds and higher total rainfall to these areas, as well as sometimes snow and hail.
          The regions of north County Galway and east County Mayo have the highest incidents of recorded lightning annually for the island, with lightning occurring approximately five to ten days per year in these areas.
          Munster, in the south, records the least snow whereas Ulster, in the north, records the most.
