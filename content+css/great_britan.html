    <h2>  United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland </h2>
    <p>
        Great Britain is an island in the North Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe.
        With an area of 209,331 km2 (80,823 sq mi), it is the largest of the British Isles, the largest European island, and the ninth-largest island in the world.
        In 2011, Great Britain had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan.
        The island of Ireland is situated to the west of Great Britain, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, form the British Isles archipelago.

        Geography
    </p>
    <p>
        Great Britain lies on the European continental shelf, part of the Eurasian Plate.
        Situated off the north-west coast of continental Europe, it is separated from the mainland by the North Sea and by the English Channel, which narrows to 34 km (18 nmi; 21 mi) at the Straits of Dover.
        It stretches over about ten degrees of latitude on its longer, north-south axis and occupies an area of 209,331 km2 (80,823 sq mi), excluding the smaller surrounding islands.
        The North Channel, Irish Sea, St George's Channel and Celtic Sea separate the island from the island of Ireland to its west.
        The island is physically connected with continental Europe via the Channel Tunnel, the longest undersea rail tunnel in the world, completed in 1993.
        The island is marked by low, rolling countryside in the east and south, while hills and mountains predominate in the western and northern regions.
        It is surrounded by over 1,000 smaller islands and islets.
        The greatest distance between two points is 968.0 km (601 1⁄2 mi) (between Land's End, Cornwall and John o' Groats, Caithness), 838 miles (1,349 km) by road.

      <p>
          The oldest rocks in Great Britain are the Lewisian gneisses, metamorphic rocks found in the far north west of the island and in the Hebrides (with a few small outcrops elsewhere), which date from at least 2,700 Ma (Ma = million years ago).
          South of the gneisses are a complex mixture of rocks forming the North West Highlands and Grampian Highlands in Scotland.
          These are essentially the remains of folded sedimentary rocks that were deposited between 1,000 Ma and 670 Ma over the gneiss on what was then the floor of the Iapetus Ocean.
