    <h2> Northern Europe </h2>
    <p> Northern Europe is the geographical region in Europe roughly north of the southern coast of the Baltic Sea, which is about 54°N.
        Narrower definitions may be based on other geographical factors such as climate and ecology.
        A broader definition would include the area north of the Alps.
        Countries which are central-western (such as Belgium and Switzerland), central (such as Austria) or central-eastern (such as Hungary and Poland) are not usually considered part of either Northern or Southern Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
        Historically, when Europe was dominated by the Roman Empire, everything not near the Mediterranean region was termed Northern European, including southern Germany, all of the Low Countries, and Austria.
        This meaning is still used today in some contexts, for example, discussions of the Northern Renaissance.

        Geography
    </p>
      <p>
          Northern Europe might be defined roughly to include some or all of the following areas: British Isles, Fennoscandia, the peninsula of Jutland, the Baltic plain that lies to the east and the many islands that lie offshore from mainland Northern Europe and the main European continent.
          In some cases, Greenland is also included.
      </p>
      <p>
        The area is partly mountainous, including the northern volcanic islands of Iceland and Jan Mayen, and the mountainous western seaboard, Scotland and Scandinavia, and also often includes part of the large plain east of the Baltic sea.
